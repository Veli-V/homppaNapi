# HomppaNappi

HomppaNappi is my personall project to code Amazon Dash button to play episode of pseudo random series on my htpc.
You can use this code if you want freely, but I give you no promises on how it will work on your machine. Additionally I will give no support for this product. Offcourse if you contact me, and be polite, I might help you. But in that case there is large IF on if I can. This has been enterily a practice project.
